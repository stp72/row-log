# Row Log

Row Log is a simple system that was started to track distance by user at a rowing club.  We needed a simple application where rowers could log their distances.  Each month, a prize will be awarded for the rower with the most meters.  This is a pilot so other prizes might be added at a later time.

The systems functionality are as follows:

  - Display a leader board ordered by the most meter rowed;
  - Allow users to sign in in order to be able to manage their log entries;
  - Allow users to update their passwords.

I'm a beginner as far as PHP goes so this is my first attempt at building an application using this language.  I'm sure there are plenty of area's for improvement so all construction criticism is welcomed!

If you like this application and would like to see new features added, please feel free to create issues for these requests.  If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to contact me.
